# 🧪 API service testing automation
This is proposal for a project structure for API services testing automation using [robot framework](https://robotframework.org/).

## 🤖 Why robot framework?
The main reason for choosing the robot framework is that I was studying it 🙃. There are many things that could be done in python in order to speed up the execution, but it another thing that I intended with this is that anyone with knowledge of robot framework but low or none knowledge of python can custom the structure at will.

## 🧰 The Project
The idea behind this project structure is to make possible the feature codification apart from the project running structure, that is, the tester can code the feature specifications and its related data and values comparisons without worry about how it will be linked.

**Project files tree:**
* 💾 [data](./data/README.md)
* 🐳 [docker](./docker/README.md)
* 🧪 [features](./features/README.md)
* 📈 output
* 💼 [resources](./resources/README.md)
* 📋 [specs](./specs/README.md)
* 🕹️ [testsManagement](./testsManagement/README.md)


A keywords interface is proposed so the feature specification has a clear procedure, making easy to write the specification and maintaing it, and this interface is presented as four main keywords: `HTTP Request`, `Validate Response`, `Validate Payload` and `Validate Endpoint`. See [features README](./features/README.md).

## 🚧 TODO
- [ ] Translate to english;
- [ ] Write a README file for each main directory;
- [ ] Elaborate and test docker partition
- [ ] Some feedback, please?🙃;
- [ ] Refactor, refactor, refactor...;

## 🤔 Future ideas
- [ ] Create a GUI to run tests. It must read the tag of each feature file, making a selection list to run tests through it avoiding the terminal.
