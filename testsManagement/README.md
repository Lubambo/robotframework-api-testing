# 🕹️ Tests Management
Tests Management contains robot files responsable for the conection and interaction between `features`, `specs` and http and database interactions.
Here all project's configurations are concentrated, so it can be done quickly, making this project structure easily adaptable.
The configurations are done as following:
* `dataManagement`: all configurations related to test data are done here, whether using database interaction or local a file. [Click here](./dataManagement/README.md) for a better explanation;

* `webServiceManagement`: the configurations involving any http interaction are done here. [Click here](./webServiceManagement/README.md) for a better explanation;
